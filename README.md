# Monty-Hall-problem







The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that catches many people out when first encountered. Vos Savant presented a solution that was, initially, rejected in the popular media of the day.

 Write a program that demonstrates that Vos Savant is correct. You will use the output of your program to convince your interviewer that, after the host opens a door, switching doors is always the correct choice.

 ## You will need to:

- Gain an understanding of the problem - perhaps see how your friends react if you play the part of the host.
- Convince yourself that Vos Savant was correct.
- Design and write software that will run sample games employing either the stick or switch strategy.
Put the code in a public GitHub repository
- Use your software to show that switching doors is statistically the best option.
- The elegance of the output is not important so long as the program can be used to prove the point.

## My understanding of the problem

- There is 1/3 chance your first choice being the one with the car in. That odd isn't improved if you decide to stick.
- However, there is 2/3 chance the car is in either behind Door 2 or 3 and once Monty reveals door number 2 to have a goat behind it, now the 2/3 odd is concentrated onto door number 3 which is why switching is the better strategy and is demonstrated by our logic.
